_________________________________

###1. Objectives
- Continuously verify and validate HCI website functionality according to specs and requirements. 
- Build and deploy a test automation framework capable of continuous verification and validation of the HCI website.

_________________________________

###2. Required Steps
1. **Elucidate app's existing workflow**  
    - what does it do?  
2. **Transform the workflow into test scripts**  
    - automate verification of what it supposed to do (Selenium WebDriver, Python)  
3. **Prioritize the maintenance and version-control of test scripts**
4. **Automate test run on checkin via github plugin**
    - now automate the execution of the automated tests (Jenkins, github, SauceLabs)
5. **Use the test results!**
    - pipe test output as an input to appropriate players

_________________________

###3. Assessment Phase
1. **Learn who's who.**
    - introductions, roles, responsibilities
2. **Learn the workflow and generate a UI sketch** 
    - use [interactive sketching notation] and Illustrator
3. **Define requirements for functional testing** 
    - Can't test everything, so what are we most concerned with? 
    - create the input, determine the output, compare to expected 
4. **Determine what to do with test results?**
    - Who receives the auto-emailed failure notifications?  SMS?
5. **Determine who writes the scripts, who runs the sripts, and who's waiting for results**
6. **Identify process and next steps**

#####Assessment for Version 2 of the automation project:
- Define and test the operational requirements for HCI website (version 2 features)
    - eg. Performance, Stress and Volume

#####Assessment for Version 3 of the automation project:
- Define and test the functional and operational requirements for the **HCI Platform**

- **Features covered in this test plan**
    - Page Load (main)
    - Subsidiary page loads
    - page content
    - internal links
    - drop downn menus
    - HCI newsletter subscribe
    - Search
    - client center
    - client login
    - switching client accounts
    - client permissions
    - promotions (eg limited-time incentives)
    - on-demand webinar replay
    - videos (eg overview of HCI embedded options)
    - social-media links
    - online demos functionality
    - scheduling online demos
    - user feedback popup menu
    - 

####**v.2:**
- UX/usability 
- performance and load testing

####**v.3+:**
- automated test framework for the **The HCI Platform**

###5. Proposed Approach for v.1
A Selenium-based multi-platform test automation suite written in Python and executed on [SauceLabs] test servers  

**Components:**  
- [Selenium Builder]
- [Selenium WebDriver]
- [Python]
- [SauceLabs]
- [pytest]



___________________________________



###6. Method
####Step 1. Build test suite prototype with [Selenium Builder]
- current location of test suite prototype ==> [se-builder-testSuite] 
- record and modify test cases
- organize test cases as suite
- execute test suite locally
- execute test suite remotely on multi platforms
- manage error reporting
- pro: 
    - rapid prototyping, extensive platform coverage
- con:
    - clumsy. lacks abstraction, won't scale

####Step 2. Create Python test scripts from prototype test suite
- current location of ported test cases ==> [unittests]
- from [Selenium Builder] port test cases to Python
- fix translation issues with [Selenium WebDriver] and [Python] caused by porting test cases
- expand [unittest] features
- modify test cases to run from command line

####Step 3. Modify Python test scripts to run multi-platform tests remotely
- to run test cases on remote servers, add:
```
webdriver.Remote()
```
- update setUp() to extend test case testing environment by specifying browsers, versions and platform
- add SauceLab account login for access to remote test servers
- improve error reporting.  How?  Switch test framework from **unittest** to **[pytest]**
- why use **[pytest]**
    - improved reporting
    - run test cases as a single test suite
    - test in parallel on multiple platforms
    - executing parallel tests from command line:
    ```
    $ py.test -n2 --boxed example.py
    ```
    - Example pytest response from parallel tests
    ```
        ============================== test session starts ==============================
        platform darwin -- Python 2.7.5 -- pytest-2.5.1
        plugins: xdist
        gw0 [2] / gw1 [2]
        scheduling tests via LoadScheduling
        ..
        =========================== 2 passed in 17.30 seconds ===========================
    ```
    - investigate [pytest_sauce]

####Step 4. Incorporate Continuous Integration Testing
- objective:  trigger execution of test suite upon change to code base
- connect [Github] <-> [Jenkins] <-> [SauceLabs]
- [Travis] - continuous integration platform

####Step 5. Improve test script resilience
- make smart, resilient, robust test scripts 
- create code abstraction
- techniques:
    - [Page Object Model]
- provide a test interface for developers and staff

####Step 6. Feedback - Recommendations - Alternatives
this is not a final step - it's an ongoing process  

**Feedback:**  
- actively pursue it.  invite it.  assume it's non-optional  

**Recommendations:**    
- remain open to the outcome rather than attached to the process (regardless of who created it from scratch)  

**Alternatives:**   
- Review alternative test methodologies and frameworks

    - triggered emails
    - In-office Alert System involving bright lights and loud sirens
         - [triggered when Raspberry Pi detects reported error]
- bug tracking
    - HCI's current system?
    - Asana
    - Jira

###8. Resources and Notes
- [Page Object Model]
    - [Martin Fowler's article](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html)
        - A page object wraps an HTML page, or fragment, with an application-specific API, allowing you to manipulate page elements without digging around in the HTML.
    - [Page Objects on Selenium wiki](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects)
- [Python Testing Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTJHQ-zQMk4) - basics of unittest, assert, and doctest
- [Building a CI System Using SE-Builder Github, Travis and SauceLabs](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2013/03/building-a-ci-system-using-selenium-builder-github-travis-and-sauce-labs/)
    - The great thing about this setup is that if you put your site code and your tests into the same GitHub repository, then whenever you update the site code, and whenever you update the tests, Travis will rerun your Selenium tests on Sauce OnDemand â€“ and then send you an email about whether or not they still work!
